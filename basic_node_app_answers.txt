1.What is a Node module?
 A: It is a set of functions you want to include in your application

2.What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A:Exports is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign the object module.exports.
 If you want your module to be a specific object type, use module.exports.
 Otherwise, use exports. Using exports is recommended unless you are planning
 on having your module be a specific object type.
 Exports is NOT returned by require() (module.exports is!). Module.exports is the object
 reference that gets returned from the require() calls.

3.Why is using exports recommended?
 It is a convenience variable to help module authors write less code.
 Working with its properties is safe and recommended.
